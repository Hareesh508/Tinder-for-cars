# Tinder-for-cars
A stack of on-sale car pictures would be placed on the front screen, one car at a time. A user can swipe right or left to the car. Swipe left means he is not interested, swipe right means we take him into car description page with a call to action button to call the dealer. Please check out Tinder app for reference
